# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a sorting algorithm based on the technique of divide and conquer 
to recursively break the original array in halves, sorting the smaller halves 
(easier subproblems) and then combining the sorted halves in a step called 
merging, with an operation called `merge`.

Merging is the basic operation that combines two of these subarrays. Given two 
sorted arrays `a` and `b`, we merge by using two pointers `i` and `j`, one for
array `a` and one for array `b`. In an auxiliary array, we compare the `a[i]` 
and `b[j]`, and the minimum of the two is added to the next entry of the 
auxiliary array, and we increment the corresponding pointer. We do this until 
both pointers have reached the end of their corresponding arrays.

The main idea behind merge sort is recursively dividing the array into halves 
until they become of size 1. Then for each pair of halves, we call the above 
`merge` operation.

Intuitively, since the `merge` operation takes the length of the longest array 
at most, it is done in O(N) time. Since we can only halve the array at most 
lgN times, it follows that merge sort overall runs in O(NlogN) time.

### Visualization

The following visualizes merge sort:

```
// Suppose we have the unordered array a:

a = [9, 5, 7, 2, 0, -1, 8, 3]

// We break the array a down into two halves:

[9, 5, 7, 2] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We recursively break it into two halves:

[9, 5] [7, 2] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We recursively break it into two halves:

[9] [5] [7, 2] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[5, 9] [7, 2] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We recursively break it into two halves:

[5, 9] [7] [2] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[5, 9] [2, 7] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [0, -1, 8, 3]

// We recursively break it into two halves:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [0, -1] [8, 3]

// We recursively break it into two halves:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [0] [-1] [8, 3]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [-1, 0] [8, 3]

// We recursively break it into two halves:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [-1, 0] [8] [3]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [-1, 0] [3, 8]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[2, 5, 7, 9] [-1, 0, 3, 8]

// We merge the two halves to sorted order:

[-1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]

// Now the array a is in sorted order.
```

One of the properties of merge sort is that is is stable, as in merge routine 
we can specify that if the element in the first array is equal to the element 
in the second array to choose the element in the first array, thereby making 
equal elements end up in the same order.

Another possibly desirable and undesirable properties of merge sort is that its 
time complexity is O(NlogN), since we always recursively break it down. This 
may be desired if predictability of the algorithm's running time is needed, but 
otherwise this is a disadvantage. Consider nearly sorted or completely sorted 
arrays. Merge Sort then has no advantage over this fact and will run in O(NlgN) 
regardless.

### Merge Sort Bottom-Up

Merge sort bottom-up is a modification of merge sort in that instead of 
recursively dividing the arrays and merging, for every pass, we merge for 
increasing sizes of subarrays. Starting from 1, we go through the array, 
merging subarrays of size 1, then 2, 4, ... etc.

The following visualizes merge sort bottom-up:

```
// Suppose we have the unordered array a:

a = [9, 5, 7, 2, 0, -1, 8, 3]

// Then we merge subarrays of size 1:

[5, 9, 7, 2, 0, -1, 8, 3]
[5, 9, 2, 7, 0, -1, 8, 3]
[5, 9, 7, 2, -1, 0, 8, 3]
[5, 9, 7, 2, -1, 0, 3, 8]

// Then we merge subarrays of size 2:

[2, 5, 7, 9, -1, 0, 3, 8]
[2, 5, 7, 9, -1, 0, 3, 8]

// Then we merge subarrays of size 4:

[-1, 0, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9]

// Now the array a is in sorted order.
```

The advantage to this modification is that we do not need any recursion. We 
also do not need to declare many subarrays when we divide the array into halves.

Likewise with regular merge sort, this algorithm runs in O(NlgN).

    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of both merge sort and merge sort bottom-up is O(NlogN).

Since they both require an auxiliary array of size N, they require O(N)
auxiliary space.

Both of them require copying elements to an auxiliary array, and thus are not
in-place. But they are stable sorts since the merging operation can be made to
respect the original order of identical elements.

```
| Algorithm            | time complexity | space complexity | in-place | stable | type       |
|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|--------|------------|
| merge sort           | O(NlogN)        | O(N)             | no       | yes    | comparison |
| merge sort bottom-up | O(NlogN)        | O(N)             | no       | yes    | comparison |
