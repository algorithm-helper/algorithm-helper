# Heap Sort

Heap sort is a sorting algorithm based on the idea of using heaps, specifically
max heaps for sorting an array through the heap operations `heapifyDown`. More 
on this can be found in the article on [Heaps](/categories/data-structures/trees/heap).

The approach to using a heap is that from the array, we build up the heap 
structure, in-place. Then we continuously swap the top of the max heap (which is 
the largest element in the heap) with the last element in the array. We then 
"remove" that element from the heap and into the finalized array by decrementing 
the size of the heap.

Then we apply the operation `heapifyDown` on the current root element of the 
heap, and continue this process until the heap is of size 0. The correctness of 
this algorithm can be seen intuitively, if we move the root of the max heap, 
which is the current max element, to the back of the heap, then in the finalized 
array that element must be in the correct position.

Since heaps are completely balanced binary trees, the height of a heap is at 
most lgN. Furthermore, when we call the `heapifyDown` operation, the most we 
must displace a wrongly positioned root item is at the bottom of the heap, so 
this element must travel the height of the tree. Intuitively, since the height 
is lgN, and we must do this for all the N items, this algorithm's running time 
is O(NlgN).

### Visualization

The following visualizes heap sort:

```
// Suppose we have the unordered array a:

a = [9, 5, 7, 12, 0, -1, 8]

// This corresponds to the following tree structure:

                     9
                  /     \
                 5       7
                / \     / \
              12   0  -1   8

// But we must construct a heap out of this, so we apply heapifyDown on the
// elements:

// heapifyDown from 9 does nothing:

a = [9, 5, 7, 12, 0, -1, 8]

// heapifyDown from 5 swaps it with 12, and swaps 12 with 9:

a = [12, 9, 7, 5, 0, -1, 8]

// heapifyDown from 7 swaps it with 8:

a = [12, 9, 8, 5, 0, -1, 7]

// This corresponds to the following tree structure, which is a valid max heap:

                     12
                  /     \
                 9       8
                / \     / \
               5   0  -1   7

// Swap the root element with the last element in the heap, then remove the
// last element from the heap:

                     7
                  /     \
                 9       8
                / \     / \
               5   0  -1   12

                     7
                  /     \
                 9       8
                / \     / \
               5   0  -1   

// Then we heapifyDown from the root:

                     9
                  /     \
                 7       8
                / \     / \
               5   0  -1   

// Now the final array a looks like this, with 12 in the correct final position:

a = [9, 7, 8, 5, 0, -1, 12]

// Swap the root element with the last element in the heap, then remove the
// last element from the heap:

                    -1
                  /     \
                 7       8
                / \     / \
               5   0   9   

                    -1
                  /     \
                 7       8
                / \     / \
               5   0      

// Then we heapifyDown from the root:

                     8
                  /     \
                 7      -1
                / \     / \
               5   0      

// Now the final array a looks like this, with 9 in the correct final position:

a = [8, 7, -1, 5, 0, 9, 12]

// Swap the root element with the last element in the heap, then remove the
// last element from the heap:

                     0
                  /     \
                 7      -1
                / \     / \
               5   8      

                     0
                  /     \
                 7      -1
                / \     / \
               5         

// Then we heapifyDown from the root:

                     7
                  /     \
                 0      -1
                / \     / \
               5         

                     7
                  /     \
                 5      -1
                / \     / \
               0         

// Now the final array a looks like this, with 8 in the correct final position:

a = [7, 5, -1, 0, 8, 9, 12]

// Swap the root element with the last element in the heap, then remove the
// last element from the heap:

                     0
                  /     \
                 5      -1
                / \     / \
               7        

                     0
                  /     \
                 5      -1
                / \     / \

// Then we heapifyDown from the root:

                     5
                  /     \
                 0      -1
                / \     / \

// Now the final array a looks like this, with 7 in the correct final position:

a = [5, 0, -1, 7, 8, 9, 12]

// Swap the root element with the last element in the heap, then remove the
// last element from the heap:

                     -1
                  /     \
                 0       5
                / \     / \

                     -1
                  /     \
                 0       
                / \     

// Then we heapifyDown from the root, but -1 is already less than 0:

                     -1
                  /     \
                 0       
                / \     


// We can stop here because the final array a is already sorted, with 5
// in the correct position:

a = [-1, 0, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12]
```

The advantage to heap sort is that because it is in-place, as we can build up 
the heap structure within the original array itself, so the extra space usage 
is only O(1).

But heap sort is not stable, making it an undesirable property if stability is 
needed.

### Implementation

##### Java

```
package com.example;

public class HeapSort<T extends Comparable<T>> {

    /**
     * Sorts the array arr.
     *
     * @param arr, the array to be sorted.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if arr is null
     */
    public static void sort(Comparable[] arr) {
        if (arr == null)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("sort with null arr");

        int n = arr.length;

        for (int i = n/2; i >= 1; i--)
            heapifyDown(arr, i, n);

        while (n > 1) {
            swap(arr, 1, n--);
            heapifyDown(arr, 1, n);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Restores the (min) heap invariant by continuously moving i
     * down the heap if it is larger than its two children.
     *
     * @param arr
     * @param i
     * @param n
     */
    private static void heapifyDown(Comparable[] arr, int i, int n) {
        while (2*i <= n) {
            int j = 2*i;
            if (j < n && less(arr, j, j+1)) j++;
            if (!less(arr, i, j))
                break;
            swap(arr, i, j);
            i = j;
        }
    }

    /**
     * Helper function that returns true if the element at index i is
     * less than the element at index j in the array arr, otherwise false.
     *
     * @param arr
     * @param i
     * @param j
     * @return true if the element at index i is less than the element at
     *         index j in the array arr, otherwise false.
     */
    private static boolean less(Comparable[] arr, int i, int j) {
        return arr[i-1].compareTo(arr[j-1]) < 0;
    }

    /**
     * Helper method that swaps the elements at index i and j in the
     * array a.
     *
     * @param arr
     * @param i
     * @param j
     */
    private static void swap(Comparable[] arr, int i, int j) {
        Comparable temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of heap sort is O(NlogN).

Since it is done in-place in the array and requires variables `i` and `j` for
the `heapifyDown` operation, it requires O(1) auxiliary space.

It is in-place, and not stable.

```
| Algorithm | time complexity | space complexity | in-place | stable | type       |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|----------|--------|------------|
| heap sort | O(NlogN)        | O(1)             | yes      | no     | comparison |
```
