# Stability

Stability in the context of sorting algorithms refers to whether or not elements 
in the array that are equal stay in the same original order after the array has 
been sorted. 

From Wikipedia:

> [Stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm#Stability) - 
Stable sorting algorithms maintain the relative order of records with equal
keys.

### Example

An example of where stability might be important is if we consider (`key`, 
`val`) pairs.

The following visualizes stability:

```
// Suppose we have an array of (key, value) pairs for (names, ages):

A = [("John", 20), ("Jack", 30), ("Mary", 28), ("John", 21)]

// We have two pairs where the keys are identical, namely "John". A stable
// sort would sort this array by name but preserve the order of the two pairs:

sortedStable = [("Jack", 30), ("John", 20), ("John", 21), ("Mary", 28)]

// But an unstable sort would not:

sortedUnstable = [("Jack", 30), ("John", 21), ("John", 20), ("Mary", 28)]
```
