# Shell Sort

Shell sort, also called Shell's method, is a sorting algorithm based on the idea
of h-sorting, which is like insertion sort, but at intervals of size `h`, or in
other words, the subsequence of every `h`-th element is sorted. An array that
is `h`-sorted, and then `k`-sorted is still `h`-sorted, where `h > k`. 

We define some increasing integer sequence to define our `h` values, and then 
`h`-sort the array based on those `h` values, in reverse, until `h` = 1, where
effectively we are doing regular insertion sort. But this takes advantage of 
the fact that by the time `h = 1`, the array is already nearly sorted (or in 
other words, with a low number of inversions), an ideal situation for insertion 
sort, as the algorithm runs in around O(N) time for nearly sorted arrays.

### Visualization

The sequence we choose is one of Knuth's: `3x + 1`. Thus we first calculate the 
integers of the sequence: `1, 4, 7, 10 ...` and then `h`-sort in reverse of 
these values. The following visualizes shell sort:

```
// Suppose we have the unordered array a:

a = [9, 5, 7, 2, 0, -1, 8]

// We start with h = 7, so this array gets sorted at indices in steps of 7:

a = [8, 5, 7, 2, 0, -1, 9]

// Next h = 4, so this array gets sorted at indices in steps of 4:

a = [2, 5, 7, 8, 0, -1, 9]

// Next h = 1, so this array gets sorted at indices in steps of 1, which is
// regular Insertion Sort:

a = [-1, 0, 2, 5, 7, 8, 9]

// Now the array a is in sorted order.
```

The main advantage shell sort has over insertion sort is that by reducing the 
array to be nearly ordered, at the end, one pass of insertion sort finishes off 
the sort efficiently.

Determining the time complexity of shell sort is highly dependent on the chosen 
gap sequence, and it is still an open question as to the best known gap sequence 
(which as of Sep. 2017 is O(Nlog^2N)). Based on literature, for the 
sequence 3x + 1, this algorithm runs in O(N^(3/2)) time.

It is an in-place sort, and not stable. It is obvious why it is not stable, 
because when it `h`-sorts, it can bring repeated values out of their original 
order.

### Implementation

##### Java

```
package algorithms.sorting;

public class ShellSort {

    /**
     * Sorts the array arr.
     *
     * @param arr, the array to be sorted.
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if arr is null
     */
    public static void sort(Comparable[] arr) {
        if (arr == null)
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("sort with null arr");

        int n = arr.length;
        int h = 1;
        while (h < n/3)
            h = 3*h + 1;

        while (h >= 1) {
            for (int i = h; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = i; j >= h && less(arr[j], arr[j-h]); j -= h)
                    swap(arr, j, j-h);
            }
            h /= 3;
        }
    }

    /**
     * Helper function that returns true if x is less than y, otherwise
     * false.
     *
     * @param x
     * @param y
     * @return true if x is less than y, otherwise false
     */
    private static boolean less(Comparable x, Comparable y) {
        return x.compareTo(y) < 0;
    }

    /**
     * Helper method that swaps the elements at index i and j in the
     * array a.
     *
     * @param arr
     * @param i
     * @param j
     */
    private static void swap(Comparable[] arr, int i, int j) {
        Comparable temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N^(3/2)).

Since it requires an extra variable to keep track of `h`, it requires O(1)
auxiliary space.

It is in-place, and not stable.

```
| Algorithm  | time complexity | space complexity | in-place | stable | type       |
|------------|-----------------|------------------|----------|--------|------------|
| shell sort | O(N^(3/2))      | O(1)             | yes      | no     | comparison |
```
