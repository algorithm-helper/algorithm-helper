# Flow Network

A flow network is a directed graph where each edge has a capacity $C$ and a flow $F$. Flow is 
something that can pass through edges at varying amounts, limited by an upper bound of the 
capacity. It follows that for every edge $e$ with flow $f$ and capacity $c$, $f \leq c$. Typically, 
flow can represent fluid passing through pipes, money passing through a foreign exchange market, or 
traffic passing through a road system, for example.

Generally, we start with a vertex $s$, known as the source, and end with a vertex $t$, known as the 
target. The sum of the flows directed towards a vertex is known as its inflow, and the sum of the 
flows directed outwards from that vertex is known as its outflow. Intuitively, the inflow must 
equal the outflow, except at the source and the target. It follows that the total flow reaching 
the target must be equal to the starting flow at the source.

The approach is that we use a separate class called `FlowCapacityFunction`, which provides the 
operations necessary to map edges to their flow and capacity, a `(flow, capacity)` pair, which are 
both `double` values, and with the restriction that their flow cannot exceed their capacity. Now, in 
addition to maintaining the vertices and edges in `GraphRepresentation`, every edge and its 
associated  that is added must also be added to `FlowCapacityFunction`, and similarly with 
deleting edges (and vertices). As a backend however, they use two `WeightFunction` objects.
We define a new interface for these types of graphs, `FlowNetwork`, with all of the necessary
operations as with regular graphs except now we have operations `getFlow`, `getCapacity`, 
`getTotalFlow`, `getTotalCapacity`. We have the concrete class `FlowNetworkGraph` that implements
this interface.

### Visualization

We draw flow networks like directed weighted graphs, except that now all edges have two associated
values, its flow and its capacity.

### Implementation (Flow Network)

The following provides the implementation for the `FlowNetwork` interface.

### Time Complexity

The time and space complexity for the operations on the graph are identical to the ones for the 
`DirectedWeightedGraph` class, even though the `FlowCapacityFunction` requires two `WeightFunction`
objects for its backend. Thus its space complexity is still proportional to `O(|V|+|E|)`. 

```
| Data Structure     | space complexity | containsVertex | containsEdge | insertVertex | insertEdge | deleteVertex | deleteEdge | getFlow | getCapacity | getDegree | getAdjacent  |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------|--------------|------------|--------------|------------|---------|-------------|-----------|--------------|
| flow network graph | O(|V|+|E|)       | O(1)           | O(degree(u)) | O(1)         | O(1)       | O(degree(u)) | O(1)       | O(1)    | O(1)        | O(1)      | O(degree(u)) |
```
