# Sparse and Dense Graphs

Sparse Graphs are Graphs such that they only have a few number of Edges, and
generally, the number of Edges E = O(V), where V is the number of Vertices.

Dense Graphs are Graphs such that the number of Edges is close to the maximal
number of Edges, and generally, the number of Edges E = O(V^2), where V is the
number of Vertices.
