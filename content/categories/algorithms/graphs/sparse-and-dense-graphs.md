# Sparse and Dense Graphs

### Sparse Graph

Sparse graphs are graphs such that they only have a few number of edges, and generally, the number
of edges is proportional to the number of vertices, or $|E| = O(|V|)$, where $|E|$ is the number of 
edges, and $|V|$ is the number of vertices.

### Dense Graph

Dense Graphs are graphs such that the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges, and 
thus the number of edges to proportional to the number of vertices squared, or $|E| = O(|V|^2)$,
 where $|E|$ is the number of edges, and $|V|$ is the number of vertices.
