# Time and Space Complexity

This article describes the time and space complexities of the algorithms described in this topic.

### Comparisons

The following is the time and space complexities of the following algorithms: Euclid's algorithm,
the Karatsuba algorithm, the Newton-Raphson method, modular exponentiation, and the Graham scan 
algorithm:

```
| Algorithm              | time complexity | space complexity |
|------------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| euclid's algorithm     | O(log(a+b))     | O(log(a+b))      |
| karatsuba algorithm    | O(N^lg3)        | O(1)             |
| newton-raphson method  | O(F(N)logN)     | O(1)             |
| modular exponentiation | O(e)            | O(1)             |
| graham scan            | O(NlogN)        | O(N)             |
