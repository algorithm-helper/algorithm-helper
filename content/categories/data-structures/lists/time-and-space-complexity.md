# Time and Space Complexity

This article will elaborate further on the time and space complexities of the
operations on the list data structures discussed in this topic. Data structures 
with similar operations will be grouped together.

### Comparisons

We start off with linked lists, double ended linked lists, and dynamic arrays 
because they have all of the same operations, and have operations to retrieve, 
insert or remove elements at arbitrary index locations within the data structure 
with `get`, `insert` and `remove`, unlike stacks and queues for example. We 
describe the time complexities for the operations `get`, `insert`, 
`insertFront`, `insertBack`, `remove`, `removeFront`, `removeBack`, `peekFront`, 
and `peekBack` below:

```
| Data Structure            | get  | insert | insertFront | insertBack | remove | removeFront | removeBack | peekFront | peekBack |
|---------------------------|------|--------|-------------|------------|--------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| linked list               | O(N) | O(N)   | O(1)        | O(N)       | O(N)   | O(1)        | O(N)       | O(1)      | O(N)     |
| double ended linked list  | O(N) | O(N)   | O(1)        | O(1)       | O(N)   | O(1)        | O(1)       | O(1)      | O(1)     |
| dynamic array             | O(1) | O(N)   | O(N)        | O(1)*      | O(N)   | O(1)        | O(1)*      | O(1)      | O(1)     |
```

For linked lists and double ended linked lists, retrieving the element at an 
arbitrary (valid) index with `get` requires traversing node by node, starting 
from the `first` node, and is hence done in O(N) time, compared to in a 
dynamic array, since we can simply index into the underlying array structure, 
done in O(1) time. 

Inserting an element at an arbitrary (valid) index with `insert` also requires 
traversing node by node until reaching the desired location for linked lists and
double ended linked lists, and is thus done in O(N) time. With dynamic arrays, 
we would need to shift all of the elements at that index `i` to the right in the 
underlying array to be able to insert the new element at `i`, and is thus done 
in O(N) time. 

Similarly, removing an element at an arbitrary (valid) index `i` with `remove` 
requires traversing node by node until reaching the desired location for linked
lists and double ended linked lists, and linking the before node (node at index
`i-1`) to the after node (node at index `i+1`), thereby effectively removing the
node at `i`, and is thus done in O(N) time. With dynamic arrays, we would need 
to shift all of the elements at index `i+1` to the left, thereby effectively 
removing the element at `i`, and is thus done in O(N) time.
  
To insert an element at the front with `insertFront` in a linked list or double 
ended linked list, we simply need to point `first` to the new node to be 
inserted, and point the new node's `next` to the original `first` node, done in
O(1) time. With a dynamic array, we would have to shift all of the elements 
starting at index 0 to the right in the underlying array structure, and must 
shift all of the elements, thus done in O(N) time. To remove an element at the 
front with `removeFront` in a linked list or double ended linked list, we simply 
need to point `first` to its `next` element, done in O(1) time. With a dynamic 
array, we would have to shift all of the elements starting at index 1 to the 
left of the underlying array structure, and must shift all of the elements, thus 
done in O(N) time.

To insert an element at the end with `insertBack` in a linked list, we have to 
traverse node by node until we reach the end, and must traverse all of the nodes 
until reaching the end, and is hence done in O(N) time. But compared to a double 
ended linked list, we can take advantage of the `last` pointer, so we simply 
need to point `last` to the new node to be inserted, and point the new node's 
`prev` to the original `last` node, done in O(1) time. For a dynamic array, we 
can simply insert the element at the next valid index location `n` in the 
underlying array structure, done in O(1) time. Similarly, to remove an element 
at the end with `removeBack` in a linked list, we have to traverse node by node 
until we reach the end, and must traverse all of the nodes until reaching the 
end, and is hence done in O(N) time. With a double ended linked list, we can 
immediately access the last and second last element with `last` and its `prev` 
node, and thus done in O(1) time. With a dynamic array, we can simply decrement 
`n`, done in O(1) time as well.

To peek elements at the front with `peekFront` in a linked list or double ended
linked list, we return the element at `first`, thus done in O(1) time. With a 
dynamic array, we simply return the element at index 0 of the underlying array, 
also done in O(1) time. To peek elements at the end with `peekBack` in a linked 
list, we would need to traverse through the entire linked list, thus done in 
O(N) time. But with a double ended linked list, we can return the element at 
`last`, thus done in O(1) time. With a dynamic array, we simply return the 
element at index `n`, thus done in O(1) time.

We will look at stacks (implemented with linked lists and dynamic arrays), 
queues (implemented with double ended linked lists and dynamic arrays) and 
double ended queues. 

For stacks, we can implement it using a linked list and a dynamic array, the 
time complexities for the operations `push`, `pop` and `peek` are 
described below:

```
| Data Structure        | push  | pop   | peek |
|-----------------------|-------|-------|------|
| stack (linked list)   | O(1)  | O(1)  | O(1) |
| stack (dynamic array) | O(1)* | O(1)* | O(1) |
```

With the linked list implementation, since `push` is simply a matter of 
pointing `first` to be the new node, this is done in O(1) time. With the 
dynamic array implementation, it is simply a matter of indexing 
into the underlying array at `n`, and assigning the new element there, done in 
O(1) time. With the linked list, `pop` is a matter of pointing `first` to its 
`next` node, done in O(1) time. With a dynamic array, we can 
decrement `n`, done in O(1) time. With the linked list, `peek` is a matter of 
returning the element at `first`, done in O(1) time. With a dynamic array, it is 
a matter of returning the element at index `n` in the underlying array.

For queues, we can implement it using a double ended linked list and a 
dynamic array, the time complexities for the operations `enqueue`, 
`dequeue` and `peek` are described below:

```
| Data Structure        | enqueue | dequeue | peek |
|-----------------------|---------|---------|------|
| queue (linked list)   | O(1)    | O(1)    | O(1) |
| queue (dynamic array) | O(1)*   | O(1)*   | O(1) |
```

With the linked list implementation, since `enqueue` is simply a matter of 
pointing `last` to be the new node, this is done in O(1) time. With the 
dynamic array implementation, it is simply a matter of indexing 
into the underlying array at index `last`, and assigning the new element there, 
done in O(1) time. With the linked list, `dequeue` is a matter of pointing 
`first` to its `next` node, done in O(1) time. With a dynamically resizing 
array, we can increment `first`, done in O(1) time. With the linked list, `peek` 
is a matter of returning the element at `first`, done in O(1) time. With a 
dynamic array, it is a matter of returning the element at index 
`first` in the underlying array.

For double ended queues, we implement it using a double ended linked
list, and the time complexities for `insertFront`, `insertBack`, `removeFront`,
`removeBack`, `peekFront`, and `peekBack` are described below:

```
| Data Structure     | insertFront | insertBack | removeFront | removeBack | peekFront | peekBack |
|--------------------|-------------|------------|-------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| double ended queue | O(1)        | O(1)       | O(1)        | O(1)       | O(1)      | O(1)     |
```

For the operations `insertFront` and `insertBack`, we can point `first` or 
`last` to the new node, respectively, done in O(1) time. For the operations 
`removeFront` or `removeBack`, we can point `first` to its `next` node or point
`last` to its `prev` node, respectively, done in O(1) time. For the operations 
`peekFront` or `peekBack`, we return the element at `first` or `last`, 
respectively, done in O(1) time.
