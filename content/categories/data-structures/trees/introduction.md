# Introduction

The topic in this section is trees, and these data structures are primarily
concerned with tree data structures, that is, a set of linked nodes such that it 
has a root and it has subtrees of children nodes, forming a tree-like structure.
The following data structures are going to be covered in this topic: binary
search trees, balanced binary search tree, 2-3 tree, red-black tree, AVL tree,
heap, priority queue and union find/disjoint set.

### Terminology

We first look at some terminology and definitions with trees.

Trees are an abstract data type that represents a tree-structure, starting with 
a root note, that points to subtrees of children node, and can be defined 
recursively with nodes (like with a binary search tree or red-black tree),
or with an array (like with a heap).

From Wikipedia:

> [Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28data_structure%29) - a tree is a 
widely used abstract data type (ADT) or data structure implementing this ADT
that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees
of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes. A tree 
data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes,
(starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a
value, together with references to notes (the children) with constraints that
no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root.

There are a lot of terminology used in trees:

- root 
    - The top-most node in the tree.
- child 
    - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.
- parent 
    - The converse notion of a child.
- siblings 
    - A group of nodes with the same parent.
- descendant 
    - A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.
- ancestor 
    - A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.
- leaf 
    - A node with no children.
- branch / internal node 
    - A node with at least one child.
- degree 
    - The number of sub trees of a node.
- edge 
    - The connection between one node and another.
- path 
    - A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
- level 
    - The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between 
    the node and the root).
- height of node 
    - The height of a node is the number of edges on the longest path between 
    that node and a leaf.
- height of tree 
    - The height of a tree is the height of its root node.
- depth 
    - The depth of a node is the number of edges from the tree's root node to 
    the node.
- forest 
    - A forest is a set of n â‰¥ 0 disjoint trees.

As well, we consider union finds/disjoint sets, which is a data structure 
concerned with dynamic connectivity and connected components, which although 
is implemented with an array, can be both represented as a linear structure as 
well as a (more efficient) tree structure. 

### Visualization

The following visualizes an tree, where the nodes are labelled and just placed
in some arbitrary order:

```
                 A
               / | \ 
              B  C  D
             / \     \ 
            E   F     G

// Node A is the root
// Nodes B, C, D are the children of A
// Node B is the parent of nodes E and F
// Nodes E and F are siblings since they have the same parent, node B
// Node G is a descendant of node A
// Nodes E, F and G are leaf nodes since they do not have any children
// Node A is an ancestor of node G
// The height of the tree is 3
// The height of node B is 1
// The heigth of node C is 0
```

### Properties

As mentioned above, trees contain a set of linked nodes, starting from a root
node with subtrees of children nodes. Although a tree may have nodes such that 
they can have an arbitrary amount of children, we will consider binary trees 
for the purposes of explaining binary search trees, red-black trees, AVL trees,
and (binary) heaps. 

A binary tree is a tree data structure where each node may each either 0, 1, or
2 children. The children of a node, say some `root`, are commonly called the 
`left` and the `right` child. In the case of trying to implement a map (more is 
discussed about this abstract data type in the article on [Maps / Symbol Table](/categories/data-structures/trees/map-symbol-table)), the key of the `left`
child is less (in whatever way that may be defined) than the key of the `root`,
and the key of the `right` child is greater than the key of the `root`. With 
maps, we store (key, value) pairs. If we implement a map using a tree, the nodes
may look like the following.

Example of a Node (Java):

```
class Node {
    private K key;
    private V val;
    private Node left, right;
    private int size;
    // other fields may go here ...
}
```

But in the case of sets (more is discussed about this abstract data type in the 
article on [Sets](/categories/data-structures/trees/set)), each node is only
associated with a key. If we implement a set using a tree, the nodes may look
like the following.

Example of a Node (Java):

```
class Node {
    private K key;
    private Node left, right;
    private int size;
    // other fields may go here ...
}
```

### Operations

There are several operations in general that we would use with tree structures.

The operation `contains` takes in a key and returns whether or not the key 
belongs in the tree. In the case of maps, the operation `get` takes in a key and 
returns the value associated with the key in the tree. Also in the case of maps,
the operation `put` takes in a (key, value) pair and inserts it into the tree
in the appropriate place, but if the key already exists in the tree, then it 
just updates the value to the new value. With sets, we insert the key into the 
tree, and if the tree already contains the key, then it does nothing.

We may want operations `max` and `min` to get the maximum and minimum keys in
the tree, respectively. The operations `delete`, `deleteMin` and `deleteMax`
removes (key, value) pair with some key, removes the (key, value) pair with the 
maximum key, and removes the (key, value) pair with the minimum key, 
respectively.

We may also want oeprations `floor`, which returns the largest key less than or 
equal to the given key, `ceil`, which returns the smallest key greater than or
equal to the given key, `select`, which returns the k-th smallest key in the
tree, and `rank`, which returns the number of keys less than the given key.
