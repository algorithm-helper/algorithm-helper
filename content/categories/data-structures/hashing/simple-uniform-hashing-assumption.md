# Simple Uniform Hashing Asssumption

The Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption, also abbreviated as SUHA, states that
for a given hash function `h`, we are able to map the universe U of possible
keys to {0, 1, ... m - 1}, where each key is equally likely to be hashed to any
slot in the table, independent of where other keys have hashed.

### Properties

The main idea behind using a hash function is that we can take advantage of 
this assumption and expect that because the N keys are distributed across M 
slots, that the expected length of slots (how many keys hash to that slot) is 
N/M. Thus, we define the load factor `alpha = N/M`.

Intuitively, with separate chaining, as long as we can make sure that the number
of these slots M increases with N to maintain a good load factor, then the 
average length of these linked list chains can be kept small. We do not want
chains to get excessively long, because then the structure effectively 
degenerates to O(N) time for operations like `contains` or `get`.

With linear probing, as long as we can increase the size of the table, we can 
keep the expected number of needed probes until finding an available slot to be 
small. We do not want clusters to get larger, because then the structure 
also effectively degenerates to O(N) time for operations like `contains` or 
`get`.

So it follows that the hash table/hash map or hash set implementations also have
mechanisms to keep track of the values M and N, and when N grows large, then 
the size of the array is enlarged and all of the keys must be rehashed and
reinserted back into the structure.
