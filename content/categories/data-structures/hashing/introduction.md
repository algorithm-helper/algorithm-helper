# Introduction

The topic in this section is hashing, and these data structures are primarily
concerned with using hash functions to implement efficient data structures. 
The following data structures are going to be covered in this topic: hash 
tables/hash maps and hash sets.

The main motivation behind hashing is to speed up lookup. Consider searching 
a linear data structure for a given `key`. In an unsorted array, or a linked
list for example, this would take O(N) time. Even with a balanced binary tree
data structure, say a red-black tree, this would take O(lgN) time. However, we
could use a hash function to compute some index into the array, and whenever
we need to lookup a `key`, instead of traversing through the data structure
trying to find the `key`, we can just compute the index with the hash function
and immediately get to the "vicinity" of where to find the `key`. This is 
further clarified in the article on [Hash Functions](/categories/data-structures/hashing/hash-function).

### Visualization

The following visualizes the general idea behind hashing:

```
// Suppose we had a universe U of possible keys, some key x from U, a hash 
// function h, and an array of size M:
 - - - -
|       |               Index 
|       |                 0   [ ]
|   U   | --> h(x) -->    1   [ ]
|       |                 2   [ ]
|       |                ...  [ ]
 - - - -                 M-1  [ ]

// We take the hash value of x, h(x) to find an index into the array, and 
// store x there, say for example h(x) = 2:
 - - - -
|       |               Index 
|       |                 0   [ ]
|   U   | --> h(x) -->    1   [ ]
|       |                 2   [x]
|       |                ...  [ ]
 - - - -                 M-1  [ ]
```

### Terminology

We first look at some terminology and definitions with hashing.

A hash function is a function to map keys from a universe of all possible keys
U to an index value into an array of size M. This index value is in {1, 2, ... 
m-1}.

From Wikipedia:

[Hash Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) - a hash function 
is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to data of fixed 
size. The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, 
digests, or simple hashes. One use is a data structure called a hash table, 
widely used in computer software for rapid data lookup.

Since there are much more possible keys than there are available locations in 
the array, eventually there will be two different keys that will hash to the 
same slot. This is called a collision.

From Wikipedia:

[Collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_%28computer_science%29) - 
a collision or clash occurs when two different inputs to a function, typically
one used to compress large data items into a smaller or fixed size, produce the
same output, called a hash value, checksum, fingerprint, or digest. Collisions
are unavoidable whenever members of a very large set are mapped to a relatively
short bit string.

It becomes clear that this hash function `h` must also "evenly distribute" the
keys over the M possible slots. Intuitively, this must be case for the hash 
table/hash map or hash set to not have its performance degenerate to O(N) time.
For example, if `h` produces hash values of 2 more often then other values, then
given a arbitrary amount of keys to be hashed, there will be an imbalance at
index 2. In the case of linear probing for example (more can be read on linear 
probing in the article on [Collision Resolution](/categories/data-structures/hashing/collision-resolution)),
not only would this result in a larger cluster starting at index 2, but because
the probability to hash to index 2 is higher, then the probability for the 
cluster to grow at index 2 also becomes larger, which leads to performance
degenerating to O(N).

We assume that `h` evenly distributes `keys` to slots, and this is called the 
Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption. 

From Wikipedia:

[Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUHA_%28computer_science%29) -
The SUHA (Simple Uniform Hashing Assumption) is a basic assumption that 
facilitates the mathematical analysis of hash tables. The assumption states that
a hypothetical hashing function will evenly distribute items into the slots of 
a hash table. Moreover, each item to be hashed has an equal probability of 
being placed into a slot, regardless of the other elements already placed. This 
assumption generalizes the details of the hash function and allows for certain 
assumptions about the stochastic system.
