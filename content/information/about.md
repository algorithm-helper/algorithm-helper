Algorithm Helper is an online reference tool for beginner, intermediate, or 
advanced programmers to look up sample implementations and notes on a 
multitude of different algorithms, data structures and programming paradigms,
with the goal of presenting the information in a clear and concise way.

It is meant to be a comprehensive education resource that anyone can use for
free. For the algorithms and data structures sections, we will have 
introductions explaining general overviews of the topic, their approach, 
intuition and primary motivation, analyze their time and space complexities,
describe real world applications and practical implications.
Code implementations are currently in Java, C/C++, Python and JavaScript.

The git repository for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/algorithm-helper).
