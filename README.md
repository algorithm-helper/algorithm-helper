# Algorithm Helper

Algorithm Helper is an online reference tool for beginner, intermediate or
advanced programmers to look up sample implementations and notes on a multitude
of different algorithms, data structures and programming paradigms. It is meant
to be an comprehensive educational tool. For the algorithms and data 
structures, we will have introductions explaining their approach and intuition,
analyze their time and space complexities, and describe real world applications 
as well as practical implications. Implementations are currently in Java, 
C/C++, Python and JavaScript.

## Starting up

Get a copy of the project so that you can use Algorithm Helper offline as 
reference, or for testing purposes. In the terminal:

```
npm start
```

For `babel` to transpile ES6 to ES5 code, `gulp-compress` to minify ES5 code,
and `nodemon` to detect changes and restart server when needed:

```
npm test
```
